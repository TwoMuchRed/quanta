> You currently cannot deploy Quanta to a static host, such as Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or GitHub Pages. Vercel does work - however, it is experimental and some things may not work as intended.

## Run locally

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) installed on your system.

````bash
git clone https://github.com/twomuchred/quanta.git # Clone the repo
npm install # Install packages
npm start # Start the bare server + serve static files
````
